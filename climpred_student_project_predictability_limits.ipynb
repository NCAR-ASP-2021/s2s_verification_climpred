    "\n",
    "When verifying against reanalysis (a gridded version of observations), we are introducing an error since the model evolution will be different from that in real nature, due to truncation (and other) errors. To get an estimate of the predictability limit for a particular process, we can verify the ensemble against one of the ensemble members rather than reanalysis. This will give us a predictability limit for a particular process assuming there is no difference between the model and nature. This is also called “potential predictability”. Obviously, this estimate can be wrong if the model does not represent the physical process correctly.\n",
